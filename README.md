# Overdrive-VST-Plugin
Built in C++ &amp; JUCE, as an AAU and VST compatible plug-in for DAWs.

Features a Mix Slider and a Drive slider. As someone who produces music primarily in Logic, the stock Overdrive plug-in does not have a mix knob, so in order to mix in my distorted signal I have to put the plug-in on a bus and adjust the original level fader alongside the drive bus fader. Because of the mix slider, this plug-in allows you to quickly add a little distortion to your signal without having to use an additional bus.
